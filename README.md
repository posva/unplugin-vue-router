> Zero-config File based type safe Routing in Vue

This build-time plugin simplifies your routing setup **and** makes it safer and easier to use thanks to TypeScript. Requires Vue Router at least 4.1.0.

‚ö†Ô∏è This package is still experimental. If you found any issue, design flaw, or have ideas to improve it, please, open an [issue](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router/issues/new/choose) or a [Discussion](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router/discussions).

## Install

```bash
npm i unplugin-vue-router
```

<details>
<summary>Vite</summary><br>

```ts

import VueRouter from 'unplugin-vue-router/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    VueRouter({
      /* options */
    }),
  ],
})
```

export default {
  plugins: [
    VueRouter({
      /* options */
    }),
  ],

  /* ... */
  plugins: [
    require('unplugin-vue-router/webpack')({
      /* options */
    }),
  ],
}
```

<br></details>

<details>
<summary>Vue CLI</summary><br>

```ts
// vue.config.js
module.exports = {

        /* options */
      }),
    ],
  },
}
```

<br></details>

Then, you can run your dev server (usually `npm run dev` to generate the first version of the types) you can replace your imports from `vue-router` to `@vue-router`:

```diff
-import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
+import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from '@vue-router'

createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  // You don't need to pass the routes anymore,
  // the plugin writes it for you ü§ñ
})
```

Make sure to also check [the TypeScript section](#typescript) below if you are using TypeScript.

## Configuration

Have a glimpse of all the existing configuration options with their corresponding **default values**:

```ts
VueRouter({
  // Folder(s) to scan for vue components and generate routes. Can be a string or an array of strings.
  routesFolder: 'src/routes'
  // Path for the generated types. Defaults to `./typed-router.d.ts` if typescript
  // is installed. Can be disabled by passing `false`.
  dts: './typed-router.d.ts',

  // Override the name generation of routes. unplugin-vue-router exports two versions:
  // `getFileBasedRouteName()` (the default) and `getPascalCaseRouteName()`. Import any
  // of them within your `vite.config.ts` file.
  getRouteName: (routeNode) => myOwnGenerateRouteName(routeNode),
})
```

## Routes folder structure

By default, this plugins checks the folder at `src/routes` for any `.vue` files and generates the corresponding routing structure basing itself in the file name. This way, you no longer need to maintain a `routes` array when adding routes to your application, **instead just add the new `.vue` component to the routes folder and let this plugin do the rest!**

Let's take a look at a simple example:

```
src/routes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.vue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.vue
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ users/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.vue
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [id].vue
```

This will generate the following routes:

- `/`: -> renders the `index.vue` component
- `/about`: -> renders the `about.vue` component
- `/users`: -> renders the `users/index.vue` component
- `/users/:id`: -> renders the `users/[id].vue` component. `id` becomes a route param.

### Index Routes

Any `index.vue` file will generate an empty path (similar to `index.html` files):

- `src/routes/index.vue`: generates a `/` route
- `src/routes/users/index.vue`: generates a `/users` route

### Nested Routes

Nested routes are automatically defined by defining a `.vue` file alongside a folder **with the same name**. If you create both a `src/routes/users/index.vue` and a `src/routes/users.vue` components, the `src/routes/users/index.vue` will be rendered within the `src/routes/users.vue`'s `<RouterView>`.

In other words, given this folder structure:

```
src/routes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.vue
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ users.vue
```

You will get this `routes` array:

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/users',
    component: () => import('src/routes/users.vue'),
    children: [
      { path: '', component: () => import('src/routes/users/index.vue') },
    ],
  },
]
```

While omitting the `src/routes/users.vue` component will generate the following routes:

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/users',
    // notice how there is no component here
    children: [
      { path: '', component: () => import('src/routes/users/index.vue') },
    ],
  },
]
```

Note `users/` could be any valid route like `my-[id]-param/`.

#### Nested routes without nesting layouts

Sometimes you might want to add _nesting to the URL_ in the form of slashes but you don't want it to impact your UI hierarchy. Consider the following folder structure:

```
src/routes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.vue
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [id].vue
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.vue
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ users.vue
```

### Named routes

All generated routes that have a `component` property will have a `name` property. This avoid accidentally directing your users to a parent route. By default, names are generated using the file path, but you can override this behavior by passing a custom `getRouteName()` function. You will get TypeScript validation almost everywhere, so changing this should be easy.

### Dynamic Routes

You can add [route params](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html) by wrapping the _param name_ with brackets, e.g. `src/routes/users/[id].vue` will create a route with the following path: `/users/:id`.

You can create [**optional params**](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/route-matching-syntax.html#optional-parameters) by wrapping the _param name_ with an extra pair of brackets, e.g. `src/routes/users/[[id]].vue` will create a route with the following path: `/users/:id?`.

You can create [**repeatable params**](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/route-matching-syntax.html#repeatable-params) by adding a plus character (`+`) after the closing bracket, e.g. `src/routes/articles/[slugs]+.vue` will create a route with the following path: `/articles/:slugs+`.

And you can combine both to create optional repeatable params, e.g. `src/routes/articles/[[slugs]]+.vue` will create a route with the following path: `/articles/:slugs*`.

### Catch all / 404 Not found route

To create a catch all route prepend 3 dots (`...`) to the param name, e.g. `src/routes/[...path].vue` will create a route with the following path: `/:path(.*)`. This will match any route. Note this can be done inside a folder too, e.g. `src/routes/articles/[...path].vue` will create a route with the following path: `/articles/:path(.*)`.

## TypeScript

This plugin generates a `d.ts` file with all the typing overrides when the dev or build server is ran. Make sure to include it in your `tsconfig.json`'s `include` or `files` property:

```js
{
  // ...
  "include": [/* ... */ "typed-router.d.ts"]
  // ...
}
```

Then, you will be able to import from `@vue-router` (instead of `vue-router`) to get access to the typed APIs. You can commit the `typed-router.d.ts` file to your repository to make your life easier.

### Extra types

You can always take a look at the generated `typed-router.d.ts` file to inspect what are the generated types. `unplugin-vue-router` improves upon many of the existing types in `vue-router` and adds a few ones as well:

#### `RouteNamedMap`

The `RouteNamedMap` interface gives you access to all the metadata associated with a route. It can also be extended to enable types for **dynamic routes** that are added during runtime.

```ts
import type { RouteNamedMap } from '@vue-router/routes'
```

Extending types with dynamically added routes:

```ts
declare module '@vue-router/routes' {
  import type {
    RouteRecordInfo,
    _ParamValue,
    // these are other param helper types
    _ParamValueOneOrMore,
    _ParamValueZeroOrMore,
    _ParamValueZeroOrOne,
  } from 'unplugin-vue-router'
  export interface RouteNamedMap {
    // the key is the name and should match the first generic of RouteRecordInfo
    'custom-dynamic-name': RouteRecordInfo<
      'custom-dynamic-name',
      '/added-during-runtime/[...path]',
      // these are the raw param types (accept numbers, strings, booleans, etc)
      { path: _ParamValue<true> },
      // these are the normalized params as found in useRoute().params
      { path: _ParamValue<false> }
    >
  }
}
```

#### `RouterTyped`

The `RouterTyped` type gives you access to the typed version of the router instance. It's also the _ReturnType_ of the `useRouter()` function.

```ts
import type { RouterTyped } from '@vue-router'
```

## Extending existing routes

You can extend existing routes by passing an `extendRoutes` function to `createRouter()`. **This should be uses as a last resort** (or until a feature is natively available here):

```js
import { createWebHistory, createRouter } from '@vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
  extendRoutes: (routes) => {
    const adminRoute = routes.find((r) => r.name === '/admin')
    if (!adminRoute) {
      adminRoute.meta ??= {}
      adminRoute.meta.requiresAuth = true
    }
    // completely optional since we are modifying the routes in place
    return routes
  },
  history: createWebHistory(),
})
```

As this plugin evolves, this function should be used less and less and only become necessary in unique edge cases.

## Rationale

This project idea came from trying [to type the router directly using Typescript](https://github.com/vuejs/router/pull/1397/commits/c577998f3edaa6a1eb9474c27ab6c58f6e2d7c8a), finding out it's not fast enough to be pleasant to use and, ending up using build-based tools, taking some inspiration from other projects like:

- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) - The Vue.js Framework
- [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) - Framework agnostic file based routing
- [Typed Router for Nuxt](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/nuxt-typed-router) - A module to add typed routing to Nuxt
